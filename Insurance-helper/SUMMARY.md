## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Four Specialized Insurance Agents

| Agent | Model Name | Use Case |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **General Assistant** | `insurance_advisor` | General insurance questions, navigation |
| **Claims Analyst** | `claims_analyzer` | Claim denials, appeals, denial codes |
| **Coverage Advisor** | `coverage_advisor` | "Is X covered?", policy interpretation |
| **Billing Specialist** | `billing_specialist` | Medical bills, EOBs, billing errors |

### 2. Multi-Hop RAG for Complex Insurance Questions

```
User Question → Query Generation (5-8 queries) → Parallel RAG Search → 
  Comprehensive Synthesis with Citations
```

**Result:** 3-4x more information retrieved than single-query RAG

### 3. Insurance-Specific Query Generation

Automatically extracts:
- CPT codes (e.g., CPT 47562)
- ICD-10 codes
- Denial codes (CO-50, PR-1, etc.)
- Dollar amounts
- Coverage percentages
- In-network vs out-of-network status

### 4. Smart Document Processing

- **Larger chunks**: 1000 chars (vs 800 for general docs)
- **More overlap**: 250 chars (vs 200)
- **Higher top-k**: 8 results (vs 6) for complex policies
- **Keyword extraction**: 20 keywords (vs 15) for insurance terminology

### 5. Privacy-First Architecture

- Client-side PDF parsing (never uploaded)
- Local AI models (Ollama)
- No cloud services
- HIPAA-conscious design

NEXT_PUBLIC_LF_MODEL=insurance_advisor
```

### Claims Analyzer
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_LF_MODEL=claims_analyzer
```

Use for: Claim denials, appeals, understanding denial codes

**Example questions:**
- "My claim was denied with code CO-50. What does this mean?"
- "How do I appeal this denial?"

### Coverage Advisor
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_LF_MODEL=coverage_advisor
```

Use for: "Is X covered?" questions, policy interpretation

**Example questions:**
- "Does my plan cover physical therapy?"
- "What's my coinsurance for specialist visits?"

### Billing Specialist
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_LF_MODEL=billing_specialist
```

Use for: Medical bills, EOBs, billing errors

**Example questions:**
- "Why is my bill different from my EOB?"
- "Is this balance billing?"

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Install models
ollama pull gemma3:1b
ollama pull qwen3:1.7b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# 2. Start LlamaFarm
cd Insurance-helper
lf init
lf start

# 3. Add your insurance policy
mkdir -p data/policies
cp ~/Downloads/your-policy.pdf data/policies/
lf datasets add insurance_policies -s insurance_policy_processor -b insurance_policies_db
lf datasets ingest insurance_policies ./data/policies/*.pdf
lf datasets process insurance_policies

# 4. Run app
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open: **http://localhost:3000**

## What to Do Next

### 1. Add Your Insurance Policy
See `GETTING_STARTED.md` for detailed instructions.

The app becomes **much more useful** once you add your actual insurance policy to the knowledge base!

### 2. Try Different Agents
Switch between specialized agents by editing `.env.local` and restarting.

### 3. Upload Documents in Browser
Try uploading an EOB or medical bill and asking questions about it.

### 4. Customize Further
See `CUSTOMIZATIONS.md` for:
- Adding new specialized agents
- Creating additional databases
- Optimizing for your use case

## Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Hop RAG Flow

```
1. User uploads EOB showing claim denial
       ↓
2. Fast model (gemma3:1b) analyzes EOB
   - Extracts denial code (e.g., CO-50)
   - Identifies procedure (e.g., CPT 47562)
   - Generates 5-8 focused queries
       ↓
3. Queries executed in parallel against ChromaDB
   - Each query searches your policy
   - Retrieves 10 results per query = 50 total
   - Deduplicates to top 15 unique excerpts
       ↓
4. Capable model (qwen3:1.7b) synthesizes
   - Receives: Original question + EOB + 15 policy excerpts
   - Generates: Comprehensive answer with:
     * What the denial code means
     * Your policy's coverage for this procedure
     * Why it was denied
     * How to appeal
     * Required documentation
     * Timeline
```

### Privacy Design

```

│   (Your computer)   │  ← Text extracted & chunked
└──────────┬──────────┘  ← Only top 6 excerpts sent down
