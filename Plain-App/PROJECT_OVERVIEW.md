## Architecture

### Multi-Hop Agentic RAG Workflow

The application implements a sophisticated three-step AI workflow that goes beyond traditional RAG:

```
User Question + Uploaded PDF
           ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 1: Query Generation             │
│ Model: gemma3:1b (fast)              │
│ - Analyzes user's medical documents  │
│ - Extracts key abnormal findings     │
│ - Generates 4-6 focused queries      │
│ - Output: <rag_question> XML tags    │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 2: Parallel RAG Retrieval       │
│ - Executes multiple queries          │
│ - Searches ChromaDB (768-dim cosine) │
│ - Retrieves top-K excerpts per query │
│ - Deduplicates results               │
│ - Returns 10-15 unique excerpts      │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 3: Comprehensive Synthesis      │
│ Model: qwen3:1.7B (capable)          │
│ Context includes:                    │
│ - User's original question           │
│ - Uploaded PDF excerpts              │
│ - Initial analysis from Step 1       │
│ - All RAG results from Step 2        │
│ Output: Streamed comprehensive reply │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why Multi-Hop?**

Traditional RAG sends a single query to retrieve documents. Our multi-hop approach:
1. **Generates diverse queries** - A fast model analyzes complex medical documents (e.g., lab results with multiple abnormal values) and creates separate queries for each finding
2. **Casts a wider net** - Multiple parallel searches retrieve more comprehensive information from the knowledge base
3. **Context-rich synthesis** - The final model receives ALL information (user docs, initial analysis, RAG results) to produce the most complete, accurate response

**Real-world example:**
- User uploads lab results showing high LDL (145), low Vitamin D (23.1), high glucose (120)
- Traditional RAG: Single query → retrieves info about one issue
- Multi-hop RAG: Generates 4 queries (cholesterol, vitamin D, glucose, dietary changes) → retrieves comprehensive information about ALL findings

### Two-Tier Model Strategy

| Model | Purpose | Size | Temperature | Max Tokens | Use Case |
|-------|---------|------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **gemma3:1b** | Query generation | 134MB | 0.3 | 300 | Structured outputs, XML tag generation, fast analysis |
| **qwen3:1.7B** | Response synthesis | 1GB | 0.5 | 2000 | Comprehensive medical explanations, citations |
| **nomic-embed-text** | Vector embeddings | 274MB | N/A | N/A | Semantic similarity search in ChromaDB |

**Design rationale:**
- **Small fast model** for structured tasks (query generation) - saves resources, faster iteration
- **Larger capable model** for final synthesis - better medical knowledge, more coherent explanations
- **Specialized embedding model** - optimized for semantic search, not chat

### Privacy-First Architecture

**Client-Side Processing (Browser):**
1. PDF uploaded → parsed with PDF.js (WebAssembly)
2. Text extracted → chunked semantically (800 chars, 200 overlap)
3. Similarity ranking → BM25-like scoring for local excerpts
4. Only short excerpts (typically 6 chunks = ~5KB) sent to localhost

**Server-Side Processing (Localhost Only):**
1. LlamaFarm API (port 8000) - not exposed to internet
2. ChromaDB vector database (Docker container)
3. Ollama LLM inference (local process)
4. Celery workers for background processing

**Data Flow:**
- ✅ PDF files: Never leave browser
- ✅ Full document text: Stays in browser memory (cleared on refresh)
- ✅ Short excerpts: Only sent to localhost:8000
- ✅ No external API calls
- ✅ No telemetry or tracking

## Key Features

### 1. Client-Side PDF Parsing
```typescript
// lib/pdf.ts
import * as pdfjsLib from "pdfjs-dist";

// Use CDN-hosted worker for reliability
pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc =
  `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/${pdfjsLib.version}/pdf.worker.min.mjs`;

export async function parsePdfToText(file: File) {
  const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
  const pdf = await pdfjsLib.getDocument(arrayBuffer).promise;

  const pages = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= pdf.numPages; i++) {
    const page = await pdf.getPage(i);
    const textContent = await page.getTextContent();
    pages.push(textContent.items.map(item => item.str).join(" "));
  }

  return { text: pages.join("\n\n"), pages: pdf.numPages };
}
```

**Why client-side?**
- **Privacy:** Medical documents contain PHI (Protected Health Information) - never upload to servers
- **Speed:** No network latency for large files
- **Offline-capable:** Works without internet connection (after models downloaded)
- **Transparency:** User can see exactly what's happening in browser DevTools

### 2. Streaming Server-Sent Events (SSE)

The application uses SSE for real-time response streaming, supporting both OpenAI format and custom agent format:

```typescript
// lib/sse.ts
export async function* parseSSEStream(response: Response): AsyncGenerator<StreamEvent> {
  const reader = response.body.getReader();
  const decoder = new TextDecoder("utf-8");
  let buffer = "";

  while (true) {
    const { value, done } = await reader.read();
    if (done) break;

    buffer += decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
    const parts = buffer.split(/\n\n/);

    for (let i = 0; i < parts.length - 1; i++) {
      const chunk = parts[i];
      if (!chunk.startsWith("data:")) continue;

      const data = chunk.replace(/^data:\s*/, "").trim();
      if (data === "[DONE]") {
        yield { done: true };
        return;
      }

      const json = JSON.parse(data);

      // Support both OpenAI format and custom agent format
      const token = json.token ?? json.choices?.[0]?.delta?.content ?? "";
      const citations = json.citations ?? json.choices?.[0]?.delta?.citations;

      yield { token, citations, done: json.done };
    }

    buffer = parts[parts.length - 1];
  }
}
```

**Dual format support enables:**
- **OpenAI compatibility:** Works with standard OpenAI API format
- **Custom agent format:** Supports our multi-hop RAG agent with `{token, citations, done}` format
- **Graceful degradation:** Falls back to alternative formats if one fails

### 3. Multi-Think Block Parsing

One of the most challenging features was handling **two separate `<think>` blocks** in streaming responses:

1. **First `<think>` block** = Agent steps (query generation, RAG retrieval status)
2. **Second `<think>` block** = Model's internal reasoning (if extended thinking enabled)

```typescript
// components/chat/MessageBubble.tsx
const parseContent = (content: string) => {
  const thinkRegex = /<think>([\s\S]*?)<\/think>/g;
  const thoughts: string[] = [];
  let mainContent = content;
  let hasOpenThink = false;

  // First, extract all CLOSED <think> blocks
  let match;
  while ((match = thinkRegex.exec(content)) !== null) {
    thoughts.push(match[1].trim());
  }

  // Remove all closed blocks from main content
  mainContent = content.replace(thinkRegex, '');

  // Check if there's an UNCLOSED <think> tag remaining
  if (mainContent.includes("<think>")) {
    hasOpenThink = true;
    const thinkIndex = mainContent.indexOf('<think>');
    const thinkContent = mainContent.substring(thinkIndex + 7); // Skip "<think>"
    thoughts.push(thinkContent.trim());
    // Remove from main content
    mainContent = mainContent.substring(0, thinkIndex).trim();
  }

  return { thoughts, mainContent, hasOpenThink };
};
```

**The challenge:**
- During streaming, `<think>` arrives before `</think>`
- Content after `<think>` was appearing in main chat area
- Needed to handle multiple think blocks simultaneously
- Had to differentiate "Agent steps" vs "Analysis"

**The solution:**
1. Extract all **closed** think blocks first (regex)
2. Remove them from content
3. Check if there's still an **unclosed** `<think>` in remaining content
4. If yes, that's the currently streaming thought
5. Auto-expand the last thought section during streaming
6. Label first block "Agent steps", second "Analysis"

### 4. Semantic Text Chunking

```typescript
// lib/chunk.ts
export function chunkTextSmart(text: string, maxChunkSize = 800, overlap = 200): string[] {
  const paragraphs = text.split(/\n\n+/);
  const chunks: string[] = [];
  let currentChunk = "";

  for (const paragraph of paragraphs) {
    if (currentChunk.length + paragraph.length > maxChunkSize && currentChunk) {
      chunks.push(currentChunk.trim());
      // Overlap: keep last part of previous chunk
      const words = currentChunk.split(/\s+/);
      const overlapWords = words.slice(-Math.floor(overlap / 5));
      currentChunk = overlapWords.join(" ") + " " + paragraph;
    } else {
      currentChunk += (currentChunk ? "\n\n" : "") + paragraph;
    }
  }

  if (currentChunk) chunks.push(currentChunk.trim());
  return chunks;
}
```

**Why paragraph-based chunking?**
- Preserves semantic meaning (doesn't split mid-sentence)
- Overlap ensures context isn't lost at chunk boundaries
- Medical concepts often span paragraphs - overlap helps maintain coherence

### 5. Local Similarity Ranking (BM25-like)

For uploaded PDFs, we rank chunks locally before sending to the agent:

```typescript
// lib/rank.ts
function computeScore(query: string, chunk: string): number {
  const queryTerms = query.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/);
  const chunkLower = chunk.toLowerCase();

  let score = 0;
  for (const term of queryTerms) {
    // TF (Term Frequency)
    const matches = (chunkLower.match(new RegExp(term, 'g')) || []).length;
    // IDF approximation (penalize common words)
    const idf = term.length > 3 ? 1.5 : 0.5;
    score += matches * idf;
  }

  return score;
}

export function extractTopExcerpts(query: string, chunks: string[], topK = 6): string[] {
  const scored = chunks.map(chunk => ({
    chunk,
    score: computeScore(query, chunk)
  }));

  return scored
    .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
    .slice(0, topK)
    .map(item => item.chunk);
}
```

**Why local ranking?**
- Reduces context sent to LLM (only relevant sections)
- Faster than embedding every chunk
- Good enough for short-term session context
- Falls back to RAG for medical knowledge

## Agent Implementation

### Multi-Hop RAG Orchestration

The `/api/agent-chat/route.ts` endpoint orchestrates the entire multi-hop workflow:

```typescript
// Step 1: Generate RAG queries using fast model
const QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT = `Analyze the user's medical document and generate search queries.

STEP 1: Write a brief summary (2-3 sentences) of key findings
STEP 2: Generate 4-6 diverse search queries covering DIFFERENT aspects

OUTPUT FORMAT:
<summary>Brief 2-3 sentence summary</summary>

<rag_question>first specific search query</rag_question>
<rag_question>second specific search query</rag_question>
...`;

const queryGenResponse = await fetch(chatUrl, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: LF_FAST_MODEL,        // gemma3:1b
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: `${QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT}\n\n${prompt}` }],
    temperature: 0.3,
    max_tokens: 300,
    rag_enabled: false,
  }),
});

// Parse XML tags to extract queries
const ragQuestionRegex = /<rag_question>(.*?)<\/rag_question>/gs;
const queries = [...generatedQueriesText.matchAll(ragQuestionRegex)]
  .map(match => match[1].trim())
  .slice(0, 8); // Max 8 queries

// Step 2: Execute RAG queries in parallel
const ragPromises = queries.map(query =>
  fetch(ragUrl, {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query,
      database: LF_DATABASE,
      top_k: topK,
      score_threshold: scoreThreshold,
    }),
  })
);

const ragResponses = await Promise.all(ragPromises);
const allResults = ragResponses.flatMap(r => r.results);

// Deduplicate by content
const uniqueResults = Array.from(
  new Map(allResults.map(r => [r.content.substring(0, 100), r])).values()
).slice(0, 15);

// Step 3: Synthesize response with ALL context
const synthesisPrompt = `${SYNTHESIS_PROMPT}

USER'S QUESTION: ${prompt}

USER'S UPLOADED DOCUMENTS:
${userDocsContext}

INITIAL ANALYSIS:
${initialAnalysis}

RETRIEVED MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE:
${ragContext}`;

const synthesisResponse = await fetch(chatUrl, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: LF_MODEL,              // qwen3:1.7B
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: synthesisPrompt }],
    temperature: 0.5,
    max_tokens: 2000,
    stream: true,
    rag_enabled: false,           // Already done manually
  }),
});
```

**Key design decisions:**

1. **Why XML tags instead of JSON for query generation?**
   - Small models (gemma3:1b) struggle with consistent JSON formatting
   - XML tags (`<rag_question>`) are easier to parse with regex
   - More robust to formatting errors

2. **Why parallel RAG queries?**
   - Faster: All queries execute simultaneously
   - Comprehensive: Each query targets different aspects
   - Diverse results: Multiple perspectives on the topic

3. **Why manual deduplication?**
   - Multiple queries can retrieve same excerpts
   - Simple hash-based dedup (first 100 chars)
   - Keeps top 15 unique results

4. **Why disable RAG in synthesis call?**
   - RAG already executed manually in Step 2
   - Prevents double-retrieval
   - Full control over context composition

## LlamaFarm Configuration

```

**Configuration highlights:**

- **Multi-model setup:** Switch between models via API (`model: "fast"` or `model: "default"`)
- **Ollama base URL:** Must include `/v1` suffix for OpenAI compatibility
- **Paragraph chunking:** Preserves semantic meaning of medical content
- **Overlap strategy:** 200 char overlap prevents context loss at boundaries
- **Keyword extraction:** YAKE algorithm extracts medical terminology
- **Content statistics:** Tracks readability, vocabulary complexity

### Dataset Lifecycle

```bash
# Create dataset
lf datasets add medical_textbooks \
  -s medical_textbook_processor \
  -b medical_db

# Ingest files (glob patterns supported)
lf datasets ingest medical_textbooks ./data/textbooks/*.txt

# Process (2-3 hours for full dataset)
lf datasets process medical_textbooks

# Check status
lf datasets list
lf rag stats --database medical_db

# Query the database
lf rag query --database medical_db "What causes high cholesterol?"
```

**Processing details:**
- **Time:** 2-3 hours for 18 textbooks (125,830 chunks)
- **Vector creation:** 300K+ embeddings (768 dimensions each)
- **Storage:** ChromaDB persists vectors to disk
- **Parallelization:** Celery workers process chunks concurrently

## What We Learned

### 1. Small Models Can Handle Structured Tasks

**Discovery:** gemma3:1b (134MB) is excellent for structured output generation when properly prompted.

**What worked:**
- XML tags (`<rag_question>`) instead of JSON
- Clear STEP 1, STEP 2 formatting
- Examples in the prompt
- Low temperature (0.3) for consistency

**What didn't work:**
- Complex JSON schemas (frequent formatting errors)
- System messages (LlamaFarm strips them)
- High temperature (0.7+) led to inconsistent output

**Lesson:** Use small models for structured tasks, save large models for complex reasoning.

### 2. Multi-Hop RAG > Traditional RAG

**Traditional RAG problems:**
- Single query misses nuances in complex medical documents
- Lab results with multiple abnormal values only retrieves info about one
- User has to ask multiple follow-up questions

**Multi-hop solution:**
- Fast model generates diverse queries automatically
- Parallel retrieval provides comprehensive coverage
- Synthesis model receives complete picture

**Result:** 3-4x more relevant information retrieved, better user experience.

### 3. Streaming Requires Careful State Management

**Challenges:**
- Multiple `<think>` blocks arriving at different times
- Content appearing in wrong sections during streaming
- Auto-expanding sections without flickering
- Handling both closed and unclosed tags

**Solutions:**
- Extract closed blocks first, then check for unclosed
- Use `substring()` instead of regex for open tags
- `useEffect` hook for auto-expansion
- Separate state tracking for auto-expand vs manual expand

**Key insight:** Parse in two passes - closed blocks first, then unclosed.

### 4. Browser Extensions Break Things

**Problem:** MetaMask and other extensions inject scripts that cause:
- Console spam (100+ error messages)
- Next.js dev overlay errors
- Hydration warnings (`dcvalue` attribute)

**Solution:** Override `console.error` and `console.warn` to filter:
- `chrome-extension://` URLs
- `MetaMask` strings
- `__nextjs_original-stack-frame` (Next.js trying to parse extension errors)

**Lesson:** Always suppress known browser extension noise in development.

### 5. Privacy-First Requires Careful Architecture

**Design decisions:**
- PDFs parsed in browser (never uploaded)
- Only excerpts sent to localhost (not full documents)
- No external API calls
- ChromaDB runs in Docker (not cloud-hosted)
- LlamaFarm API not exposed to internet

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex setup (Docker, Ollama, LlamaFarm)
- Higher resource requirements (local LLMs)
- Longer processing time (2-3 hours for dataset)

**Benefit:** Complete privacy - suitable for PHI/medical records.

### 6. Dataset Quality Matters More Than Size

**MedRAG advantage:**
- Pre-chunked by medical experts
- Authoritative sources (Harrison's, Schwartz's, etc.)
- Structured as paragraphs (preserves context)

**Alternative approach we rejected:**
- Scraping Wikipedia/WebMD (inconsistent quality)
- Splitting textbooks ourselves (lose expert chunking)
- Using larger but lower-quality datasets

**Lesson:** 125K high-quality chunks > millions of low-quality chunks.

### 7. UX Details Matter in AI Applications

**Small improvements with big impact:**
- Auto-expanding think sections (users see AI reasoning immediately)
- Labeling "Agent steps" vs "Analysis" (clarity)
- Collapsible sections (reduces clutter)
- "Processing..." animation (visual feedback)
- Streaming responses (perceived speed)

**User feedback incorporated:**
- "Think tags showing in response" → Fixed parsing
- "Can't see what AI is thinking" → Auto-expand
- "Two thought processes confusing" → Better labels
- "Console is messy" → Suppress extension errors

**Lesson:** Iterate based on actual usage patterns.

### 8. Documentation Is Critical for Local-First Apps

**Challenges:**
- Multi-step setup (Docker, Ollama, LlamaFarm, dataset)
- 2-3 hour processing time needs clear warnings
- Cross-platform differences (macOS/Linux/Windows)

**Solutions:**
- Detailed Quick Start with timing estimates
- Step-by-step instructions for each platform
- Troubleshooting section with common issues
- Optional subset testing (10 min instead of 2-3 hours)

**Lesson:** Complex setup requires thorough documentation.

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times

| Stage | Time | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| PDF parsing (10 pages) | 1-2 sec | Client-side, depends on file size |
| Query generation | 2-3 sec | gemma3:1b, 300 tokens max |
| RAG retrieval (6 queries) | 1-2 sec | Parallel ChromaDB queries |
| Response synthesis start | 0.5 sec | TTFB (time to first byte) |

- **Privacy-preserving architecture** (client-side PDF parsing)
- **Modern web technologies** (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind)

...we built an application that:
- ✅ Runs completely offline (after initial setup)
- ✅ Handles sensitive medical data securely
- ✅ Provides comprehensive, cited answers
- ✅ Streams responses in real-time
- ✅ Scales to personal use cases

The code is open-source and available at: https://github.com/llama-farm/local-ai-apps/tree/main/Medical-Records-Helper

### Key Takeaways

1. **Small models are underrated** - gemma3:1b can handle structured tasks excellently
2. **Multi-hop RAG works** - generates better results than single-query RAG
3. **Privacy doesn't mean poor UX** - local apps can be fast and responsive
4. **Streaming is essential** - users need feedback during 20-30 second responses
5. **Documentation matters** - complex setup requires clear instructions
6. **Iterate based on usage** - small UX improvements have big impact
7. **Dataset quality > quantity** - 125K expert-curated chunks beat millions of web scrapes

### Lessons for Future Local-First AI Apps

1. **Plan for 2-tier architecture** - Small model for structure, large for reasoning
2. **Support streaming from day one** - Retrofitting is painful
3. **Handle browser extensions** - They will break things
4. **Document timing expectations** - Users need to know if something takes 2 seconds or 2 hours
5. **Test with real users early** - Assumptions about UX often wrong
6. **Invest in debugging tools** - Console logs for streaming state saved hours
7. **Keep it simple** - Complexity is the enemy of local-first apps
